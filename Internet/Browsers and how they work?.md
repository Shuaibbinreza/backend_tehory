## üåê How a Web Browser Works ‚Äî With Examples & Scenarios

### üßçScenario:
You open **Google Chrome** and type `https://news.ycombinator.com` to check the latest tech news.

---

### 1. **User Inputs a URL**
**Example:**
```text
https://news.ycombinator.com
```
**What happens:**  
The browser recognizes:
- **Protocol** ‚Üí `https` (secure)
- **Domain** ‚Üí `news.ycombinator.com`

> üí° Think of it like typing a destination into Google Maps. You give the browser the address of where you want to go.

---

### 2. **DNS Resolution**
**Scenario:**  
Your browser asks a DNS server:  
‚ÄúHey, what‚Äôs the IP address of `news.ycombinator.com`?‚Äù

**Response:**  
The DNS server replies with something like: `209.216.230.240`.

> üìç Like asking someone for directions, and they give you the exact house address.

---

### 3. **Establishing a TCP + TLS Connection**
**Example:**
- Chrome initiates a **TCP handshake** to connect to the server.
- Since you're using HTTPS, a **TLS handshake** ensures all data is encrypted.

> üîê It's like shaking hands to agree on a secret language before you start chatting.

---

### 4. **Sending an HTTP Request**
**Example Request:**
```http
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: news.ycombinator.com
```

> üì© You send a letter asking: ‚ÄúPlease send me the homepage.‚Äù

---

### 5. **Receiving the Server Response**
**Example Response:**
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
```

And then the server sends the HTML file.

> üì¨ The server replies: ‚ÄúSure! Here‚Äôs the HTML page you asked for.‚Äù

---

### 6. **Parsing HTML ‚Äì DOM Construction**
**Example:**
```html
<html>
  <head><title>Hacker News</title></head>
  <body>
    <a href="item?id=1234">Top Story</a>
  </body>
</html>
```

The browser builds a **DOM Tree** like:
```
HTML
 ‚îú‚îÄ HEAD
 ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ TITLE: "Hacker News"
 ‚îî‚îÄ BODY
     ‚îî‚îÄ A (link): "Top Story"
```

> üå≤ The DOM is the browser‚Äôs way of making a blueprint from the raw HTML.

---

### 7. **Loading CSS ‚Äì CSSOM Construction**
**Scenario:**  
The HTML links to a CSS file:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
```

**Example CSS:**
```css
a { color: orange; }
```

Browser builds the **CSSOM** to apply styles.

> üñåÔ∏è It‚Äôs like picking out how each part of the house should be decorated.

---

### 8. **Render Tree Creation**
DOM + CSSOM = Render Tree

Only visible elements are included.

> üìê It's the visual draft of the web page.

---

### 9. **Layout (Reflow)**
The browser calculates the exact position of each element:
- Where the link appears
- How wide it should be
- How much space it takes

> üßÆ Like an architect finalizing room sizes and positions.

---

### 10. **Painting**
The browser fills in pixels:
- Draws text "Top Story"
- Colors it orange
- Adds any background

> üñçÔ∏è Like coloring inside the lines on a drawing.

---

### 11. **Compositing**
If some elements are in layers (e.g., modals or overlapping images), the browser decides the **stacking order** and sends it to the GPU for final rendering.

> üé¨ It‚Äôs like Photoshop merging all your image layers into one final picture.

---

### 12. **Running JavaScript**
**Scenario:**
JavaScript adds interactivity. When you click ‚ÄúTop Story‚Äù, the script might:
- Fetch more details about that story
- Show a modal popup
- Update the page without reload (AJAX)

> ‚öôÔ∏è Like a remote control that makes parts of the site react to you.

---

### 13. **Handling User Events**
You scroll, click, or type ‚Äì and JavaScript reacts.

**Example:**
```javascript
document.querySelector('a').addEventListener('click', () => {
  alert("You clicked the top story!");
});
```

> üñ±Ô∏è The browser listens and responds like a personal assistant.

---

### 14. **Reflows and Repaints**
If the DOM is changed (e.g., new content is added), the browser may:
- **Recalculate layout** (Reflow)
- **Repaint** changed parts (e.g., a color change)

> üèóÔ∏è Like remodeling just one room instead of the whole house.
