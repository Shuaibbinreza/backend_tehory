- **Email** became a popular tool among researchers.
- *Analogy*: Creating a shared language so everyone on different roads (networks) can understand each other.

---

### 3. **1980s ‚Äì Expanding the Network**
- Networks grew beyond the military to include universities and scientists.
- **DNS** (Domain Name System) introduced in 1984.
- *Analogy*: Adding street signs (domain names) so you don‚Äôt need to remember every house‚Äôs coordinates (IP addresses).

---

### 4. **1990s ‚Äì The World Wide Web**
- **WWW** invented by Tim Berners-Lee (1991) using HTML, HTTP, and URLs.
- Browsers like **Mosaic** and **Netscape** made the web accessible to the public.
- *Analogy*: It‚Äôs like opening the roads to everyone, adding shops (websites), and giving people maps (browsers).

---

### 5. **2000s ‚Äì Broadband and Social Media**
- Faster Internet (broadband) replaced dial-up.
- Rise of platforms like **Google**, **Facebook**, **YouTube**, and **Wikipedia**.
- *Analogy*: Roads became highways, and people started building entire communities online.

---

### 6. **2010s ‚Äì Mobile and Cloud Era**
- Smartphones made the internet portable.
- Cloud services like Google Drive and AWS reshaped how we store data.
- *Analogy*: The Internet moved from desktop to pocket, and everyone started using shared warehouses for data.

---

### 7. **2020s ‚Äì AI, IoT & 5G**
- AI, Internet of Things, and 5G are shaping a hyper-connected world.
- *Analogy*: Now even your fridge and car are online, talking to each other and you in real-time.

## üåê How the Internet Works ‚Äî Step-by-Step

### üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è**Scenario:**
You open your phone and type `www.bbc.com` to read the news.

---

### 1. **You Enter a URL**
You type:  
`https://www.bbc.com`

> üî§ **URL** = human-friendly name of a website  
> *Analogy*: Like typing a friend's name into your contact list.

---

### 2. **DNS ‚Äì Translating the Name**
Your device asks the **Domain Name System (DNS)**:  
> ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the IP address of www.bbc.com?‚Äù

It gets back something like:  
`151.101.0.81`

> üó∫Ô∏è *Analogy*: DNS is like a phonebook‚Äîit finds the actual number (IP address) behind the name.

---

### 3. **Establishing a Connection**
Your device uses **TCP/IP** to connect to the BBC server at that IP address.

- **TCP** ensures reliable delivery.
- **IP** ensures it goes to the right place.

> ü§ù *Analogy*: Like setting up a phone call with a friend‚Äîyou both say hello, check the line is clear, and start talking.

---

### 4. **Sending a Request**
Your browser sends a **GET request**:
```http
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.bbc.com
```

> üì© *Analogy*: You send a letter asking for the latest BBC homepage.

---

### 5. **The Server Responds**
The BBC web server sends back:
- HTML (content)
- CSS (style)
- JS (interactivity)
- Images, videos, etc.

> üì¶ *Analogy*: BBC sends you a package with the page pieces inside.

---

### 6. **Browser Renders the Page**
Your browser:
- Parses the HTML (creates the DOM tree)
- Applies CSS (creates CSSOM)
- Runs JavaScript
- Renders everything on screen

> üß± *Analogy*: Like building a house from blueprints and decorating it.

---

### 7. **Secure Transmission (HTTPS)**
If the site uses HTTPS:
- The data is encrypted via **TLS**
- Keeps it safe from hackers

> üîê *Analogy*: Like sealing your letter with a special lock only the recipient can open.

---

### 8. **User Interaction**
You scroll, click, or type ‚Äî JavaScript reacts instantly.
If you click a link or button:
- A new request might be sent to the server
- The process repeats for new content

> üñ±Ô∏è *Analogy*: Like sending follow-up questions and getting instant replies.
